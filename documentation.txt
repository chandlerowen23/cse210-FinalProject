What is in the project?	 

We made a prototype of the game. 
The prototype has a welcome screen, also the user is able to play. 
The shooter has three lives and in each live, the shooter is able to receive 8 shots. 
When the shooter runs out of lives the game finishes with a “you lost” message on the screen. 
The enemies are the virus and they also are able to shot the shooter. 
We use these classes so far:	 
  
constants.py	 
  
sprites.py	 
  
states.py	 
  
main.py	 
  
 	
Who is doing what?	 
  
Chandler Owen worked on the messages on the screen such as the welcome screen and instructions 
Also worked with the images and sound.	 
  
Christian worked on the sprites class and worked connecting all the files.	 
  
 	
Problem and Task:	 

Add sound for when you are hit by the enemy
  
We need to work on the game over screen. 	 
  
We need to create more classes, take some functions in states class, and put them in other files.	 
  
We need to work to display the high score at the end of the game.
