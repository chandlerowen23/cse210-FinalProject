What is in the project?

We made a prototype of the game. The prototype has a welcome screen, also the user is able to play. The shooter has three lives and in each live the shooter is able to receive 8 shots. When the shooter run out of lives the game finishes with an “you lost” message in the screen. The enemies are the virus and they also are able to shot the shooter. We use this classes so far:

constants.py
sprites.py
states.py
main.py

Who is doing what?

Owen worked on the messages in the screen such as the welcome screen and instructions, and also worked with the images and sound.
Christian wroked on the sprites class and worked connecting all the files.

Problem and Task:

We need to work on the game over screen.
We need to create more classes, take some functions in states class and put them in other files.
We need to work to display the high score at the end of the game.
