What is in the project?	 

We made a prototype of the game. 
The prototype has a welcome screen, also the user is able to play. 
The shooter has three lives and in each live, the shooter is able to receive 8 shots. 
When the shooter runs out of lives the game finishes with a “you lost” message on the screen. 
The enemies are the virus and they also are able to shot the shooter. 
We use these classes so far:	 
  
constants.py	 
  
sprites.py	 
  
states.py	 
  
main.py	 
  
 	
Who is doing what?	 
  
Chandler Owen worked on the messages on the screen such as the welcome screen and instructions 
Also worked with the images and sound. then completed the game over screen.
  
Christian worked on the sprites class and worked connecting all the files.	Also added the info_text.py and states.py
  
 	
Problem and Task:	 

Add sound for when you are hit by the enemy	  - Chandler, completed

Add Sound for when the enemy is hit by mask or syringe - Chandler, Complete

Adding boss level every five stages would be fun
  
We need to create more classes, take some functions in states class, and put them in other files.	 
  
We need to work to display the high score at the end of the game.	

-------------------------------------------------------- WEEK MARCH 20------------------------------------------------------

-stages.py
  This file contains the functions to get new enemies and also the function to get more enemies when the user get up to a new level.
-info_text.py
  It contains all the text configuration and the text for the introduction text and the game over text

We also got the game_over text to work and with the option to keepplaying or returnn to menu
